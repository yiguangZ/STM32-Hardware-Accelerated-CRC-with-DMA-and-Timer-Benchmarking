# STM32-Hardware-Accelerated-CRC-with-DMA-and-Timer-Benchmarking
An embedded systems project using the STM32L476 MCU that computes CRCs via hardware acceleration and DMA, measuring timing performance with SysTick. It demonstrates low-level peripheral interaction, including LED signaling, UART output, and performance analysis with and without DMA.
